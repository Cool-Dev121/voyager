# Versioning for Voyager

We try to follow [semver](http://semver.org/) versioning standards as good as we can.   

This means that any changes to the current stable version of Voyager should be done targeting the `master` branch which will be relased as a patch release. Which will increase the last number of the version, example 1.0.**1**.

However any breaking change **must** be targeting the `develop` branch, which will be released as a minor or major release. Which will increase the middle or first version number.

If you have questions about this, please join our Slack team.
