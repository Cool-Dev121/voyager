# Upgrading

## Upgrading 1.1 to 1.x

### Update your Composer.json

To update to the latest version inside of your composer.json file make sure to update the version of voyager inside the require declaration inside of your composer.json to:

```text
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/the-control-group/voyager.git"
        }
    ],

    "require": {
        "tcg/voyager": "1.x-dev"
    }
}
```

And then run `composer update`

Or simply run:

```text
composer require tcg/voyager:1.x-dev
```

### Update Configuration {#update-configuration}

The `voyager.php` configuration file has had a few changes.

```php
'storage' => [
    'disk' => 'public',
],
```

is now

```php
'storage' => [
    'disk' => env('FILESYSTEM_DRIVER', 'public'),
],
```

Also, the option

```php
'database' => [
    'autoload_migrations' => true,
]
```

was added. This allows you to exclude Voyagers migration-files from loading when running `php artisan migrate`.

You can now define an array of mimetypes which are allowed to be uploaded through the media-manager.
```php
'allowed_mimetypes' => '*', //All types can be uploaded
/*'allowed_mimetypes' => [
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/png',
  'image/gif',
  'image/bmp',
  'video/mp4',
],*/
```

### Deprecation
`can`, `canOrAbort`, `canOrFail` in the Voyager facade were all removed in favor of Policies and Gates.  
Please refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization).

### **Final Steps**

Next, you may want to be sure that you have all the latest published assets. To re-publish the voyager assets you can run the following command:

```text
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=voyager_assets --force
```

Then you may wish to clear your view cache by running the following command:

```text
php artisan view:clear
```
